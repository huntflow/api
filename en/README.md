# Huntflow API

[Русский](../README.md) | **English** 

Huntflow is a professional ATS.

Huntflow API is a service which helps to integrate [Huntflow](https://huntflow.ru) into your career site, intranet or any other program. 

You need to register an application for creating services that require user authorization by sending a request to [support@huntflow.ru](support@huntflow.ru) and set up an [authorization process](authorization.md).

If you are going to use Huntflow API in scripts or server side applications it's also possible to simplify authorization process by getting [personal token](personal_token.md).

SLA: Our developers answer the questions at [Issues page](https://github.com/huntflow/api/issues) in 3 working days.
