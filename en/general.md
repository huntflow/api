### Errors and response codes

API uses reporting by response codes.
The application has to process them adequately.

In the case of malfunction the response codes can be `503` and `500`.

Every error report shall contain the response code and additional information in order to help the developer understand the reason of the current error report.
[More about errors](errors.md).

### Page by page output

In the requests aimed to get a list of objects one can state a `page=N&count=M` in the parameters. Page count starts with 1 and the first page with 30 objects is returned by default. Every response with page by page output has the same root object type:

```json
{  
  "page": 1,
  "count": 1,
  "total": 1,
  "items": [{}]
}
```
