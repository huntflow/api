# Webhooks

## What are webhooks?
Webhooks are an easy way to notify your inner systems about actions that happen with candidates in Huntflow. 

Huntflow can send candidate's data to CRM system 1C or intranet if the candidate is moved to the stage "Work commencement". You can develop a chatbot which will send links to the candidate to Slack or Telegram. 

## Technical side of things
Technically, webhook is a POST request, that out system sends to your remote server. All the inforamtion about subject, object and changes of data is contained in the body of the request and its headers.

## How to create a webhook?
1. Go to company settings. 
2. Get sure that API is enabled.

3. Add a webhook, state an URL, secret key (optional) and choose events you want to subscribe to. When you add a webhook, the system checks its validity. To pass this check the server should return the code `200` or `204` to the PING-type request.

4. If the check is successful, the webhook will be added (you can add up to 5 webhooks). You can edit or delete webhooks after creating. To do that, click on the certain line from the list.
